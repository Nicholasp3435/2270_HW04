 /**
 * <strong>MergeSortStrategy</strong> - Implements merge sort for sorting lists,
 * an efficient, stable, comparison-based, divide-and-conquer algorithm. It's
 * ideal for large datasets not sortable in memory, using an auxiliary list for
 * merging.<br><br>
 * <p>
 * This educational template encourages understanding merge sort's recursive
 * nature and efficiency for large datasets. It's part of a toolkit introducing
 * advanced sorting algorithms in Java, beyond naive sorting approaches.<br><br>
 * </p>
 *
 * <strong>Note:</strong> This class is for educational purposes and not
 * optimized for production. Unauthorized distribution or publishing online
 * or other platforms is not allowed.<br><br>
 *
 * Usage: Instantiate and use with <tt>SortUtils.sort</tt> to sort lists.<br><br>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of elements to be sorted, must extend {@link Comparable}.
