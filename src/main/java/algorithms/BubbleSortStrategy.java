 /**
 * <strong>BubbleSortStrategy</strong> - A bubble sort implementation for
 * sorting lists. It steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and
 * swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process repeats until the
 * list is sorted. While simple and easy to understand, bubble sort is
 * inefficient for large datasets.<br><br>
 * <p>
 * This class is designed as a practical exercise to familiarize with sorting
 * algorithms, extending the provided sorting strategy. It's not suited for
 * production use due to its inefficiency with large data.<br><br>
 * </p>
 *
 * <strong>Note:</strong> This class is intended for educational purposes to
 * demonstrate the implementation and use of decision trees. Unauthorized
 * distribution or publishing of the solution on the web or any other platform
 * is not allowed.<br><br>
 **
 * @param <T> the type of elements to be sorted, must extend {@link Comparable}
 *            for comparison.
